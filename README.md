In this project, I Test Performance of the RC4 Encryption Algorithms under Android. I have made an application with which we can send encrypted text messages. Then, the user enters the text he wants to encrypt as well as the key for encryption. Then the message is encrypted and sent. At the receiver side, the receiver also enters the key for decryption and decrypts the text message to the original message. RC4 makes use of a shared secret key for encryption and decryption. 
RC4 is the most widely used software stream cipher and is used in popular protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and WEP (to secure wireless networks). While remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, RC4 has weaknesses that argue against its use in new systems.
