Tested the Performance of the RC4 Encryption Algorithms in Android. I have made an application with which we can send encrypted text messages. The user enters the text he/she wants to encrypt as well as the key for encryption. Then the message is encrypted and sent. The receiver also enters the key for decryption and decrypts the text message to the original message. RC4 makes use of a shared secret key for encryption and decryption.
